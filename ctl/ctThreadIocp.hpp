    // ctThreadIocp

    // class that encapsulates the new-to-Vista ThreadPool APIs around OVERLAPPED IO completion ports
    //
    // it creates a handle to the system-managed thread pool, 
    // - and exposes a method to get an OVERLAPPED* for asynchronous Win32 API calls which use OVERLAPPED I/O
    //
    // Basic usage:
    // - construct a ctThreadIocp object by passing in the HANDLE/SOCKET on which overlapped IO calls will be made
    // - call new_request to get an OVERLAPPED* for an asynchronous Win32 API call the associated HANDLE/SOCKET
    //   - additionally pass a function to be invoked on IO completion 
    // - if the Win32 API succeeds or returns ERROR_IO_PENDING:
    //    - the user's callback function will be called on completion [if succeeds or fails]
    //    - from the callback function, the user then calls GetOverlappedResult/WSAGetOverlappedResult 
    //      on the given OVERLAPPED* to get further details of the IO request [status, bytes transferred]
    // - if the Win32 API fails with an error other than ERROR_IO_PENDING
    //    - the user *must* call cancel_request, providing the OVERLAPPED* used in the failed API call
    //    - that OVERLAPPED* is no longer valid and cannot be reused 
    //      [new_request must be called again for another OVERLAPPED*]
    //
    // Additional notes regarding OVERLAPPED I/O:
    // - the user must call new_request to get a new OVERLAPPED* before every Win32 API being made
    //   - an OVERLAPPED* is valid only for that one API call and is invalid once the corresponding callback completes
    // - if the IO call must be canceled after is completed successfully or returned ERROR_IO_PENDING, 
    //   the user should take care to call the appropriate API (CancelIo, CancelIoEx, CloseHandle, closesocket)
    //   - the user should then expect the callback to be invoked for all IO requests on that HANDLE/SOCKET
